# IP CODE CHALLENGE PHASE 2
## Description
This is a react application that displays a list or bots under a Bot Collection div. This bots can be selected and used to build an army. Once a bot is clicked on, it is added under the "Your Bot Army" div. If a user wants to release/remove a bot, he/she can click on the red x button at the bottom of the card to permanently remove the bot (even from the Bot Collection).
